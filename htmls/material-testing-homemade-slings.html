                    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        When participating in inherently dangerous activities, risk mitigation and safety 
                        are of utmost priority. Select companies specialize in producing and manufacturing safety 
                        products that are certified by governing bodies of safety standards. The professional procedures 
                        and standards they must follow are widely accepted to be trustworthy, however many consumers 
                        take the certifications at name value without understanding how or why they are received. This 
                        creates distrust in products that are sufficient for certain applications, but do not have the brand 
                        name and safety certifications stamped on it. Our belief is that a strong understanding of the 
                        limits of safety gear can allow for cheap, effective, and accessible alternatives to existing 
                        products. In this report, we will explore three types of loops that could be used as homemade 
                        slings in heavy-load applications. This report is intended to provide testing information that is 
                        not typically released for the products we tested under the specified conditions. As previously 
                        mentioned, risk mitigation and safety are of utmost importance in potentially dangerous 
                        situations, and anyone choosing to use this information in their own applications should do so at 
                        their own risk.

                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        We set out to determine what kind of homemade loops could be used in heavy-load 
                        applications, with an emphasis on being used as replacements for webbing in climbing cams. We 
                        considered factors such as strength, consistency, accessibility, and cost in choosing a method for 
                        a homemade sling. Typically, manufacturing companies sell slings that receive UIAA and EN566 
                        certifications. The EN566 certification requires that a sling has a minimum breaking strength 
                        (MBS) of 22kN and does not unravel when individual strands are cut while holding a 150g load.1 
                        However, forces as high as 22kN are virtually impossible in any climbing scenario. Petzl has 
                        conducted several tests of varying degrees of falls and recorded the impact forces on the belayer, 
                        anchor, and climber.2 A factor 1 fall is the most serious fall test recorded, in which the climber 
                        falls the full length of the rope, which produces high forces throughout the system. The force on 
                        the anchors and climber is reported to be 6kN and 4kN respectively. OSHA standards require 
                        that forces on a person through a harness should not exceed 8kN3. It should be noted these are 
                        worst-case scenario falls in which there is minimal rope and friction in the system to absorb the 
                        load.

                        Considering Black Diamond, a renowned outdoors and climbing gear company, sells 
                        several small cams rated as low as 5kN4, and the maximum achievable forces in a realistic 
                        climbing scenario mentioned above, we will consider a loop of 8kN or above to be sufficient as a 
                        temporary replacement for a climbing cam sling, assuming proper manufacturing, installation, 
                        and inspection.

                    <h3>Procedures</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        For our testing apparatus a tensile test was conducted on an Exceed E43 UTM at room 
                        temperature. Specifically in our setup, we used a 50KN load cell with rope test attachments rated 
                        to 5000LBF, and two aluminum Black Diamond climbing carabiners with a closed gate rating of 
                        18KN to attach our samples. It should be noted that the carabiners will elastically deform during 
                        the test which will add a degree of inaccuracy to the measurements from the crosshead, but 
                        across all tests this deformation should be nearly the same and thus the tests are comparable to 
                        each other.
                    </p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        To prepare our rope samples (6mm & 7mm Polyester Accessory Cord) six uniform 
                        lengths of material were cut and the ends melted to prevent fraying. These sections were each 
                        identified from one to six and then tied in loops using a double fisherman knot. To prepare the 
                        steel cable six uniform lengths were cut, and then crimped in a loop, with each sample being 
                        identified from one to six. The loops were each tied or crimped to a circumference of about 
                        260mm. Specimens one, two, and three of each material were then attached to the UTM between 
                        the carabiners and tested until failure/break detection from the UTM at a rate of 0.8mm/s. We 
                        chose .8mm/s because it was on the higher speed we saw for ropes and the normal testing we 
                        saw done on steel cable, which to use felt somewhat more representative of the quick loading 
                        experienced during normal use. Our initial crosshead values were taken to be just before the 
                        sample experienced any meaningful(greater than zero load fluctuation) tension. Specimens four, 
                        five, and six prior to testing were soaked overnight in water and then tested using the same 
                        procedure as the first three.
                    </p>

                    <p>ADD TABLE HERE</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        The post-test overall length of the specimen was measured with a tape measure, 
                        measuring to and from the edge of the “solid section” of each break. The area of the sample 
                        post-break was calculated from the diameter of the “solid section” of each break. In the case of 
                        the cable, measurements were estimated to be the same as the original due to the crimp failing to 
                        hold until failure of the cable itself instead allowing slipping. This made it impossible to 
                        correctly determine the points of the cable to measure to and from, in the case of the samples that 
                        fully slipped out, and for the ones that were still partially crimped their interior loop length 
                        would also not correctly reflect the part of the sample placed under tension. Additionally when 
                        the samples were measured no noticeable difference could be found for their length

                            In the table we have the summary of the values 
                            we were interested in comparing including how 
                            our tests compare to the safety rating given to the ropes as well as the best performance for price. 
                            The Cable wasn’t as strong but had the best price for its strength. However, this varied quite a bit 
                            across the cables. The failure point was always how well crimped the cable was, not the strength 
                            of the steel itself. This also meant we had no ductility or deformation due the slippage happening 
                            before the steel deforming. So we had a wide range of results. pictures of the 6mm and 7mm 
                            samples post-break. We had assumed that they would snap at the knot but instead they broke 
                            where the ropes were attached to the carabiner. Most likely due to the compressive stress at that 
                            singular point with high tension forces on either side.

                            Looking at the dry tests gives us a good idea of the reliability and absolute maximum 
                            forces these ropes can withstand as opposed to the cable which is far more unreliable. After the 
                            initial peak (where the cable finally started to slip) the graph descends in a bumpy manner as the 
                            cable slides and then catches again within the crimp.

                            Looking at the rope graphs, each break in the graph is a point where we started to hear 
                            popping as the interior started to split and give.

                            Looking at the wet graphs we see even more variation for the cables. This may be due to 
                            water being able to get into spots where the crimp wasn’t as tight and lubricate it even more. The 
                            wet tests for the rope are also very consistent and not incredibly dissimilar to the dry graphs as 
                            we thought they might be. This may be due to water not fully being absorbed into the rope in 24 
                            hours. However, the short soak in water did make a difference.

                            Looking at our averages for each material for each condition we can see that the average 
                            yield and ultimate strength for the ropes soaked in water is lower. This is also seen in the 
                            maximum loads recorded. These results show wet ropes do end up performing worse under high 
                            loads and probably will not last as long under traditional loads. We think this may be due to some 
                            water seeping into the rope fibers and causing them to expand from each other a tiny bit, losing 
                            some strength. All of our raw data and results can be accessed here.

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        After testing these materials under different conditions we learned that there is a 
                        significant difference between materials and conditions. Hand-crimping cable may not be the 
                        most reliable process according to our results. Humans are just not consistent enough to ensure 
                        the same force and placement of the crimp across multiple loops. However, steel is incredibly 
                        strong and the only weak point in those loops were the crimps. If the home manufacturing 
                        process could be perfected these would make excellent, cheap anchors.                     
                    </p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        The most relevant result was the difference one millimeter in diameter can do for rope 
                        loads as well as what prolonged moisture can do to overall load resistance. The one millimeter 
                        difference added about 4000N of load capacity for the rope which is significant. However, this 
                        does come with a higher price. Moisture also decreased the load bearing capacity by about 700N. 
                        This isn’t much compared to the overall load, but if these ropes are used in the rain consistently 
                        we can expect them to fail much sooner than dry ropes. 
                    </p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        Overall, climbers need to watch the condition their ropes are in to be safe while climbing. 
                        Moisture can cause rope failure sooner than expected. Additionally, shelling out a bit more 
                        money for a slightly larger rope isn’t a bad idea considering the additional load capacity. 
                        However, making your own climbing materials that are used to save lives may not be ideal.
                    </p>
