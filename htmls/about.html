            <h1>About Cole Rutkowski</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Cole Rutkowski and I am a passionate runner, climber, 
                and mechanical engineering student at The University of Colorado Boulder. The making of this 
                website has been driven by my passion for mechanical design and manufacturing, and I hope you find 
                this page to be insightful, thoughtful, well-researched, and informative.
            </p>
            <p>
                I often say running is my sport and climbing is my hobby. I have more passion for endurance sports, 
                but obviously climbing is way cooler! As an engineering student, I find the design and production of 
                climbing equipment to be incredibly fascinating. That makes this website somewhere between a passion 
                project and a resume that combines my school, work, and climbing experience (as well as some 
                additional side-projects).
            </p>
            <p>
                I organized the entries to have the most notable projects at the top. I took the time to enter each 
                report directly into the site rather than display a pdf or word document, but any pdf I have will be 
                available for download at the bottom of the page. If you read just one report, be sure to check out 
                <a class="link" href="../htmls/how-cams-work.html">How Cams Work</a>!
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have any questions or concerns feel free to contact me. This could be about mistakes in my 
                reports, where I got my information, how to replicate a project, or employment.
