            <h3>Introduction:</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                From Camaros to Coke cans, Aluminum 6061 is one of the most widely used metals in 
                consumer products. It is heralded for its affordability, machinability, strength to weight ratio, 
                corrosion resistance, and versatility. It is used in car parts, soda cans, fishing reels, radios, guns, 
                ladders, cameras, pipes, airplanes, and more! According to Howard Precision Metals Inc., 
                aluminum alloys will make up approximately 16% of a vehicle's weight by 2028<sup>1</sup>, with 6061 
                being primarily in parts subjected to water and weather conditions.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                After reading about how cool aluminum 6061 is, my first question was: Would I trust my 
                life to it? Well, it depends on the situation. For me, that situation is falling 30 feet with nothing 
                but .5 cubic inches of aluminum 6061 to catch me! This paper will discuss the material structure, 
                properties, manufacture, durability, and sustainability of Aluminum 6061 with a focus on the 
                mathematically brilliant logarithmic spiral found in climbing cams and the hunk of metal that is 
                the climbing nut.</p>

            <h3>A Brief History on Cams and Nuts:</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                As mountaineering progressed in the 19th and 20th century and ethics became more 
                “ethical”, and a new type of protection device was needed that could replace the old hammer and 
                piton. Pitons (essentially metal sticks) were hammered into cracks in a rock, to which a rope was 
                connected. In the case of a fall, the piton would hold the rope and the mountaineer would be 
                caught during the fall by this safety system. However, pitons damaged the rock and left unnatural 
                scars when removed or ‘bolted ladders’ when left in place. Both scenarios were seen as unethical 
                in American mountaineering: the former was seen as destructive while the latter was seen as 
                outside the adventurous spirit of the sport. So, a new method was needed to protect a route 
                ‘cleanly’, or with the ability to be removed after an ascent without damaging the rock. The first 
                solution was the humble nut.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Nuts are themselves simple; they are wedges or chocks that fit into a crack in a rock 
               (Image 1). When a climber falls, the force from the fall is put onto the nut, which, when placed 
                correctly, wedges itself tightly in the rock and holds the climber. The original nuts were fastening 
                nuts, found on railways, with cords tied around them. Later, machined models were developed 
                with aluminum and brass alloys.<sup>2</sup>
            </p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Years later, the first spring-loaded camming devices (SLCD) were developed. These use a 
                logarithmic spiral allowing for a range of crack sizes while keeping the angle constant between 
                the rock and the point of contact all within a single device (Image 2). When the friction between 
                the rock and the lobe in contact with the rock is sufficient, the lobe rolls up and cams itself into 
                place.

            <h3>Aluminum 6061 and Climbing Protection:</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                To the designers and manufacturers of these safety pieces, the first question is strength. 
                Simply put, metal is strong. The questions that follow are numerous: How strong do pieces need 
                to be? How many large loadings can they support? How can they break? If they are too soft, 
                could they get stuck? If they are too hard, could they not wedge correctly? How hard are these 
                pieces to produce? Are they light enough? Are they affordable? Can I trust them with my life? 
                And should others trust them too?
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Aluminum 7075 is the standard for climbing protection in the 21st century, but since the 
                invention of nuts and cams both 6061 and 7075 have been used. This paper is based on the not so 
                uncommon climber/engineering student that has looked at climbing gear and said, “I could make 
                that myself.” With the affordability, accessibility, and machinability of aluminum 6061, I hope to 
                come to the conclusion on if 6061 is good enough for cams and nuts.

            <h3>Material Structure:</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Aluminum 6061 is composed of Aluminum, Magnesium, Silicon, Copper, and 
                Chromium, but can also contain Iron, Zinc, Titanium, and Manganese. The specified quantities 
                for 6061 are listed below in Image 5. The reported density of Aluminum 6061 is 2.7 g/cm^3, 
                which is close to that of pure aluminum<sup>7</sup>. Aluminum has a face-centered cubic structure with unit 
                cell length of .404nm, and does not have a ductile to brittle transition<sup>8</sup>. The atomic composition 
                of the elements in Aluminum 6061 are listed below.

                For the case of climbing cams, the lobes will primarily experience bearing stress within 
                the axle hole, which is a likely point of failure. Temperature and fatigue are also important 
                factors to consider for climbing gear. A reasonable range of forces and temperature in most 
                climbing conditions is between 0 and 100 degrees fahrenheit and a maximum of 12kN of force 
                applied downward. Later, I will approximate stresses a cam will experience and compare them to 
                the material property results above to determine if Aluminum 6061 is an appropriate material for 
                cam lobes

            <h3>Processing and Production:</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Bauxite is a relatively common sedimentary rock with high aluminum content and is the 
                world’s primary source of aluminum and gallium. According to The Aluminum Association, 
                “Bauxite ore is the world’s primary source of aluminum. The ore must first be chemically 
                processed to produce alumina (aluminum oxide).”<sup>19</sup> Australia, Guinea, and China are the highest 
                producers of bauxite, accounting for more than half of the world’s production of the mineral. It is 
                usually strip mined because it is found near the surface of the mining areas. Bauxite is refined 
                through the Bayer process to produce aluminum oxide, which then is separated into aluminum 
                through electrolysis<sup>20</sup>. For aluminum 6061, Magnesium, Silicon, and Copper are the most 
                abundant elements besides aluminum. Magnesium is typically derived from magnesite or 
                dolomite for production purposes. Then it will undergo the Pidgeon process (used in China) or 
                the Dow process (United States) do produce magnesium<sup>21</sup>. Quartzite is often mined to produce 
                silicon. “Silicon of 96–99% purity is made by carbothermically reducing quartzite or sand with 
                highly pure coke. The reduction is carried out in an electric arc furnace, with an excess of SiO
                2 used to stop silicon carbide (SiC) from accumulating<sup>22</sup>”. Copper is found in a range of mined 
                materials and is one of the oldest mined materials in the world. Often, it is smelted and then 
                refined through electrolysis or fire refining.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Aluminum 6061 is produced through mixing each element within its acceptable ratios 
                    before being formed into a product through casting, rolling, extruding, or forging. For our 
                    purposes, we will look at aluminum sheets that are rolled<sup>23</sup>. Below is an image that illustrates the 
                    rolling process.

            <h3>Defects and Durability:</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Defects in Aluminum 6061 can significantly affect its material properties, and thus 
                defects must be taken into consideration when analyzing Aluminum for commercial use. 
                Common defects include porosity, inclusions, and cracking. Porosity (similar to pores) is the 
                existence of small bubbles or voids within the materials and can develop from casting and 
                welding. This weakens the strength of the material and is best to be avoided for high-load 
                bearing structures. Inclusions are impurities or particles trapped in the aluminum matrix during 
                manufacturing processes. They act as concentration points for stress and can lead to premature 
                failure from high loads. Cracking can form from improper heat treatment of aluminum and 
                propagation will lead to significant reductions in durability and strength.

            <h3>Measurements and Analysis:</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Several techniques are used to measure and analyze the material properties of 
                Aluminum 6061. The techniques include tensile and compressive tests, shear and torsion tests, 
                hardness tests, fatigue testing, and fracture toughness.
                Tensile and compression tests involve using a testing machine to enact a tensile or 
                compressive force on a specimen. During the test, data of the forces applied over time and the 
                change in length of the material are collected, which can be used to produce a stress-strain curve 
                and calculate yield and ultimate stress.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Shear and torsion tests apply a torque on a specimen and will measure the torque applied 
                and the change in angle of the specimen at the point of contact with the machine.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Fatigue tests will have a periodic force applied over a large number of repetitions to 
                determine how many loadings a specimen can undergo before failure.

            <h3>Health and Safety:</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Despite its widespread use for industrial and consumer products, excessive 
                exposure can lead to adverse side effects. Aluminum poison testing can be accessed though hair, 
                nails, sweat, blood, and urine samples. For urine sample tests, The National Center for 
                Biotechnology Information reports the threshold for neurological effects occurs at 60 
                micrograms per liter and the critical concentration of toxicity in humans that will cause 
                neurological complications occurs at 100 micrograms per liter. The effects they report are: 
                “Aluminum toxicity affects different body organs, including brain, parathyroid gland, kidney, 
                lungs, liver, bones, and bone marrow, leading to various clinical manifestations. Aluminum 
                effect on bone marrow leads to the formation of abnormal red blood cells besides its effect 
                parathyroid gland and on musculoskeletal system is represented by abnormalities like 
                osteoporosis and osteomalacia. Liver stenosis and nephrotic syndrome are other important 
                manifestations of aluminum toxicity. Brain and respiratory system can also be severely damaged, 
                followed by aluminum poisoning. Memory loss, tremor, jerk, and death are important 
                manifestations of brain injury.”<sup>30</sup> Below is a chart from Sierra Aluminum that lists the exposure 
                limits of compounds in Aluminum 6061. It is important to note that Copper and Manganese have 
                the lowest exposure limits (50 times lower than Aluminum), however because they are in much 
                lower quantities Aluminum 6061 than Aluminum, overexposure to Aluminum will occur well 
                before overexposure to the other compounds, and thus the effects of aluminum exposure are 
                more significant in regards to Aluminum 6061.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The CDC reports that aluminum can enter and leave the body through inhalation, 
                ingestion, and dermal contact. Most aluminum ingested will leave through fecal matter while 
                aluminum in the bloodstream leaves through urine. They report than oral exposure to aluminum 
                is not typically harmful, and it is debated whether oral consumption can lead to Alzheimer’s. In 
                regards to inhalation of aluminum by worker’s, the CDC says, “Workers who breathe large 
                amounts of aluminum dusts can have lung problems, such as coughing or changes that show up 
                in chest X-rays. The use of breathing masks and controls on the levels of dust in factories have 
                largely eliminated this problem.”<sup>31</sup>

                Human labor safety conditions are also an important factor to consider. Reuters reports 
                that China has some of the worst coal mine conditions in the world<sup>33</sup>, and these conditions are 
                not much improved in metal mines. AP News reports that Uyghur forced labor labor is used in 
                metal mines<sup>34</sup> and the Washington Post reports that mining in impoverished areas with neglected 
                safety factors contaminating the local population<sup>35</sup>. They report that, “Researchers... sampled 
                dust on road surfaces around Dachang. A study published in June said they found heavy-metal 
                concentrations far above national safety limits: arsenic at 111 times, cadmium at 55 times and 
                lead at 2.45 times. Heavy-metal levels inside homes were only slightly lower, according to the 
                researchers.”

            <h3>Environmental Sustainability:</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Greenhouse gas produced by the Aluminum sector is an important factor to consider 
                when using aluminum products. Below is a chart that lists the CO2 emissions in the aluminum 
                sector. High carbon emissions increase the rate of climate change by increasing the greenhouse 
                effect in the earth’s atmosphere, which traps more heat and increases global temperatures. China 
                is a larger emitter of greenhouse gasses in the aluminum industry. They are responsible for 
                producing more than half of the world’s aluminum, but are responsible for 81% of the 
                greenhouse gas emissions in the industry36. Responsible sourcing of Aluminum, reuse, and 
                recyclability are important factors to consider when purchasing Aluminum for consumer and 
                industrial purposes.

            <h3>Is Aluminum 6061 sufficient for a Spring Loaded Camming Device?</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                In this section, we will consider the forces applied to a cam, the maximum bearing force 
                in the axle hole of the lobes, the maximum downward force on a cam, the bearing strength of 
                Aluminum 6061, and the price of stock 6061 vs 7075.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                One important factor that we will not discuss is hardness and coefficient of friction 
                between the lobes and different rock types. A softer metal will deform slightly and lodge better 
                into non-uniform cracks, however it is more susceptible to permanent deformation at the point of 
                contact with the rock. The coefficient of friction between the metal and the rock is also 
                important, and if the coefficient is too low the cam will slip out of the crack. We will not discuss 
                these factors, however the coefficient of friction of Aluminum 6061 is generally accepted to be 
                sufficient in most rock types. We will make the assumptions that the lobe will not have any 
                deformation and will only break brittley at the axle hole.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Using the formula for bearing stress σ = F/A, and rearranging we get F = σA. Because a 
                cam has 4 lobes, each lobe will experience ¼ of the total force applied on the cam axle. Using a 
                derivation for force on each lobe provide by Vaino Kodas<sup>39</sup>, we get that the force on each lobe is 
                at the axle is  F = (T/4)*SQRT(1+1/μ<sup>2</sup>), where μ is the spiral coefficient (approximately .25 in 
                most cams) and T is the downward force applied on the cam. More information about the 
                derivation of forces on a single axle cam is provided on Vaino’s website as well as John 
                Middendorf’s website<sup>40</sup>. Using a diameter of .25in for the lobe hole, .5in for the thickness of the 
                lobe, and a maximum bearing stress σ of 607MPa (see table 6), and area A = diameter*thickness, 
                we can then solve for T, the maximum force applied on the cam before the lobes fail at the axle 
                whole. Our final equation if then: T = (σA) / sqrt(1+1/μ<sup>2</sup>). Plugging in and converting units, we 
                find that the maximum load the cam can support before breaking at the axle is 47.5 Kn. This is 
                well above the reported strength of cams, which is generally between 6 and 13 Kn, depending on 
                the model and size of the cam. Typically a cam will break in its shaft at the reported maximum 
                loads, thus we can conclude that Aluminum 6061 is sufficiently strong for use as a cam lobe!
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                We will next use McMaster-Carr to compare the pricing of Aluminum 6061 vs 7075. 
                Using the same dimensions for each alloy, we can compare 8” by 8” by 1” thick sheets of each. 
                Aluminum 6061 (part number 9246K61<sup>41</sup>) in these dimensions costs $78.14, which Aluminum 
                7075 (part number 9037K28<sup>42</sup>) costs $142.05.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                In this section, we determined that Aluminum 6061 is sufficiently strong when used as a 
                cam lobe and it is notably cheaper (almost half the price!) than Aluminum 7075. We can finally 
                conclude that Aluminum 6061 is a strong and affordable option to be used in a climbing cam!
