            <h3>Introduction:</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Stronger, lighter, and cheaper are recurring themes when searching for a material to use 
                in applications from biomedical to construction. In both of these industries, Ultra High 
                Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) has found its place across industries. Heralded for lubricity, abrasion 
                resistance, impact resistance, and strength-to-weight ratio, UHMWPE has found itself in a variety 
                of products. These products include, but are not limited to: sails, tents, backpacks, 
                webbing, body armor, armored vehicles, hip and knee replacements, truck lining, textiles, and 
                cutting boards.

            <h3>UHMWPE in Climbing Equipment</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Dyneema is the gold standard in the climbing world for strong and lightweight slings. 
                Dyneema Composite Fabric (also known as Cuben Fiber) is manufactured in combination with 
                polyester to produce a strong fabric that is abrasion, UV, and chemically resistant. HyperLite 
                Mountain Gear reports that, “Dyneema<sup>®</sup> Composite Fabrics are high-performance, non-woven, 
                rip-stop, composite laminates. Dyneema<sup>®</sup> fiber is laid out in opposing grid orientations, 
                sandwiched between thin outer layers of polyester film, and melded together in a high-pressure 
                autoclave. This process results in a highly durable material that is light enough to float on 
                water.”<sup>1</sup> Edelrid, a retail company for climbing products, reports that their 8mm Dyneema sling,
                weighing in at 19 grams, has a minimum breaking strength (MBS) of 22 Kn!<sup>2</sup> To report these 
                numbers, Edelrid has done extensive testing to earn the EN 566 certification, indicating the 
                trusted standard in their product.<sup>3</sup>

            <h3>Material Structure:</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                UHMWPE is a linear, synthetic thermoplastic, meaning it is a synthesized plastic that 
                hardens at low temperatures but becomes moldable above certain temperatures. Ethylene (C2H4) 
                is a gas with molecular weight 28 that forms the polymer polyethylene. The basic chemical 
                formula for polyethylene is (C2H4)<sub>n</sub>, where n is the degree of polymerization.<sup>6</sup> UHMWPE can 
                consist of up to 200,000 repeat units of polyethylene. The molecular weight of UHMWPE is 
                difficult to measure by traditional means, and thus it is inferred through its intrinsic viscosity to 
                be between 2 and 6 million grams per mole. Its density is approximately 1 gram per cubic 
                centimeter and its unit cell dimensions are a = 0.74 nm, b = 0.493, nm and c = 0.253 nm.<sup>7</sup>
                It is often copolymerized with monomers like polypropylene and can consist of up to 50% 
                copolymers while still being considered UHMWPE (under certain industrial standards). The
                addition of polymers alters the mechanical and physical properties of UHMWPE, however only 
                the monomer ethylene will be considered, as in industries such as the medical field the 
                production of UHMWPE are homopolymers. The configuration of UHMWPE is described as “a 
                two phase composite of crystalline and amorphous phases. The crystalline phase contains chains 
                folded into highly oriented lamellae, with the crystals being orthorhombic in structure. The 
                lamellae are 10-50 nm thick and 10-50 μm long. The lamellae are oriented randomly within the 
                amorphous phase with tie molecules linking individual lamellae to one another.<sup>8</sup> Below are 
                images of UHWMPE under a microscope and its phase diagrams.

            <h3>Material Properties:</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Below are charts of the material properties of UHMWPE. In regard to climbing slings, 
                the tensile strength and specific gravity allow for slings to be lightweight while still incredibly 
                strong. One property to note is the melting temperature, which is relatively low. This is important 
                because under cyclic or continuous friction, such as rubbing against a rope or rock, can lead to 
                the sling melting and ultimately failing.

            <h3>Processing and Production</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        The production of UHMWPE is a process that involves several steps to achieve a 
                        material in a usable form. Typically, ethylene must first be synthesized and then polymerized in 
                        polyethylene. Special processes are then used to achieve long chains of polyethylene that form 
                        UHMWPE. After its initial synthesis, UHMWPE is extruded or injected to form a desired shape, 
                        such as sheets, tubes, and rods. The first step would be the synthesis of ethylene, which, 
                        according to the University of South Carolina, “The conventional method of producing ethylene 
                        is steam cracking of ethane in a chemical plant by using extreme temperatures and pressures. This requires a large energy 
                        input and releases substantial amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas.”<sup>16</sup> The next step is to 
                        polymerize the ethylene gas in a process known as Ziegler-Natta polymerisation. “In 
                        Ziegler-Natta polymerisation, monomers are treated with a catalyst, such as a mixture of titanium 
                        chloride (or related compounds, like oxovanadium chloride) with triethylaluminum (or 
                        trimethylaluminum). Other components are often added, such as magnesium chloride, to modify 
                        the catalyst and improve performance.”<sup>17</sup> Finally, the polyethylene is molded into its desired 
                        shapes by melting for ram extrusion, injection molding, and compression molding. “In [ram 
                        extrusion], the molten UHMWPE is forced through a die using a ram or piston. Ram extrusion 
                        allows for the production of continuous profiles, such as rods, tubes, and sheets, with precise
                        dimensions and excellent surface finish. Compression molding is another commonly used 
                        technique for UHMWPE. In this process, the molten UHMWPE is placed into a mold cavity, and 
                        pressure is applied to shape it into the desired form. Compression molding is suitable for 
                        producing intricate parts and components with varying thicknesses. In [injection molding], the 
                        molten UHMWPE is injected into a mold cavity under high pressure. It allows for the production 
                        of complex shapes, intricate details, and large quantities of UHMWPE parts with excellent 
                        dimensional accuracy.”<sup>18</sup>

                        Possible defects in UHMWPE include void formation, creep, inclusions, and chain entanglement. 
                        Voids can form from air accumulation within the material during improper manufacturing processes, 
                        which reduces density and strength. Creep deformation can occur when the continuous load is 
                        applied to UHMWPE, especially when the material is at an elevated temperature. Inclusions in 
                        the material structure during production lead to a non-homogenous structure that creates a 
                        point of concentration for loads. Inclusions can reduce the strength of the material and lead 
                        to failure at lower values than expected. Sufficient entanglement must also be achieved in the 
                        polymer structure to maintain its mechanical properties. ScienceDirect says, “The degree of 
                        entanglement of the UHMWPE resins and products significantly affects the wear resistance and 
                        solubility of the products during processing. The less entangled the resin product, the more 
                        likely it is to dissolve evenly during production, resulting in fewer defects and better 
                        mechanical properties.”<sup>22</sup>

                        information on some of the processes and properties that are used and measured.<sup>24</sup> Some key 
                        tests that are performed are tensile, hardness, impact, chemical resistance, UV resistance, 
                        and creep testing. Universal testing machines are used to test for several load-related 
                        properties, while a Charpy impact test is used to test hardness. Chemical resistance is 
                        tested with a large selection of chemical substances from acetaldehyde to zinc sulfate, 
                        and the effects and deformations are measured to determine acceptability ratings under 
                        each chemical.

            <h3>Health and Safety:</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        UHMWPE is colorless, odorless, and non-toxic and is regarded as safe for use in most 
                        applications. It is non-carcinogenic and there are no known symptoms to exposure. 
                        A&C Plastics Inc. recommends that you seek medical attention if exposed and prolonged 
                        irritation occurs and “if thermal decomposition occurs, upper respiratory, eye, nose, 
                        and throat irritation may result.”<sup>26</sup> When working with UHMWPE, personal protective equipment 
                        is highly recommended, which includes eye protection, gloves when working with heated 
                        material, and adequate ventilation; respiratory protection is not normally required. 
                        Overall, UHMWPE is relatively safe to humans and poses little risk to health and safety.

            <h3>Environmental Sustainability</h3>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        The environmental sustainability of UHMWPE is a complex issue that is difficult to 
                        measure and does not have a clear cut answer. Plastics justifiably face scrutiny over 
                        their environmental safety factors, however the use of UHMWPE in place of shorter-lasting 
                        plastics can be seen as a net improvement on the environment. UHMWPE is non-biodegradable, 
                        and thus single and short-term use products containing the material can be harmful to the 
                        environment. Fortunately, UHMWPE is reported to be unlikely to accumulate in biological 
                        organisms and is recyclable. Polimaxx says of the disposal methods, “This material may be 
                        recycled if unused, or if it has not been contaminated so as to make it unsuitable for its 
                        intended use. Shelf life considerations should also be applied in making decisions of this type. 
                        Note that properties of a material may change in use, and recycling or reuse may not always be 
                        appropriate. Dispose of by: burial in a land-fill specifically licenced to accept chemical 
                        and / or pharmaceutical wastes or Incineration in a licenced apparatus (after admixture with 
                        suitable combustible material) Decontaminate empty containers. Observe all label safeguards 
                        until containers are cleaned and destroyed.”<sup>27</sup> Additionally, the production of UHMWPE is an energy 
                        intensive process, specifically polymerization and shaping. The processes release greenhouse 
                        gasses to the atmosphere, which pose a serious risk to the environment and climate. However, 
                        the durability of UHMWPE can reduce the use of similarly harmful materials and, when used 
                        responsibly, produce a net positive on the environment. As with most materials, it is 
                        important for companies to make educated and responsible decisions when deciding to use UHMWPE, 
                        as well as for consumers to be aware of the possible harm these products may cause.
